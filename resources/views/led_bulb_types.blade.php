                     <p style="text-align: justify;">There are two main bulb types used to display images on LED screens: DIP and SMD. Here are a few main variations on the key characteristics.</br></br>

                    The first difference involves the way color is displayed. Digital screens using DIP generally separate the key colors red, green, and blue (R, G, B) on different LEDs. Occasionally another red LED will be added resulting in one green, one blue, and two red lights in a square shaped pixel. DIP bulbs make the entire LED sign larger and thicker than SMD bulbs. Digital screens using SMD integrate all three key colors (R, G, B) into one bulb, which result in a much smaller and more compact LED panel.</br></br>

                    The second difference has to do with brightness and image quality. Digital LED panels using SMD have a dramatically brighter screen. Since the technology used in SMD screens is more advanced, it has a higher picture quality and displays a more vivid image. Digital displays using DIP are less expensive to manufacture but their brightness and resolution are lower because the technology is older.</br></br>

                    The third difference has to do with overall lifespan. Digital LED screens using SMD have a longer lifespan than those using DIP. SMD screens run on lower voltages and currents and use less power overall. The increased energy efficiency produces less heat that leads to reduced breakdown of components which allows for a longer lifespan. Knowing the key differences between DIP and SMD will help you choose the best digital LED sign for your business.</p>

                     <h3>SMD Bulb</h3>
                     <p>This is newer technology. SMDs can be made much smaller and a lot thinner because the part is only soldered to the “surface” of one side of the circuit board.</p>

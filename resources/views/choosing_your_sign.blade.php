                     <p style="text-align: justify;">Believe it or not, finding the right digital LED sign for your business takes a little more thought than most people imagine. Choosing the right sized LED model with proper resolution for your business depends on a few key questions. For example, where will your digital sign will be installed? Will your sign be seen by pedestrians walking close by at a slow speed or by vehicles far away moving at fast speeds? Will you display pictures, videos, or both? Our professional team at GDTEK can help you assess the answers to these questions and choose the best LED sign for your business..</p>

                     <h3>Pitch, Resolution, Viewing Distance, and Angle</h3>
                     <p>The resolution of your LED sign ultimately depends on the particular pixel pitch of the model you choose. A smaller pixel pitch means that there is a larger number of pixels on a smaller surface area. This translates to a higher resolution which is ideal for viewing at a close proximity near eye level. A larger pixel pitch means that there is a smaller number of pixels on a larger surface area. This translates to a lower resolution which is ideal for seeing from a far distance high above ground level.</p>

                     <h3>What Size Sign?</h3>
                     <p>To determine the appropriate size for your location, take into consideration the speed and type of traffic, distance from the roadway, space restrictions, zoning constraints and desired sign content.</p>

                     <h3>Budget</h3>
                     <p>As with most big purchases, quality, features and size will all affect the price of your LED sign. It’s important to remember that an LED sign should not be viewed as a capital investment. Instead, look to your marketing and advertising budgets. Unlike traditional advertising methods, LED signs offer incredible value and ongoing return on investment. Consider this: when you invest in an LED sign, you control the “publication” of your message. You won’t lose time and money getting an ad into circulation. Instead, your advertising will reach people when they’re most able to act on it. We’ve seen business owners sacrifice quality for price and purchase an inferior, imported product only to have it replaced a few months later. A low price can be enticing, but your initial savings may cost a lot more than you bargained for. The fact is your investment in an LED sign is just too large to gamble your success on a cut-rate product.</p>
